===========

This program runs on a Wago Linux controller.
Its job is to export the external inputs and outputs in a controlled fashion.

It implements the following features:

 * read inputs
 
 * write outputs
 
 * set or clear an output for a pre-set time

 * periodically set+clear an output (Pulse Width Modulation)

 * send a notification whenever an input changes

 * count input transitions, with report timer (i.e. don't send a network message at every transition)

as well as some auxiliary functions

 * measure controller's cycle time

 * set program's poll time

 * (re)initialize outputs, in case of network outage

 * keepalive messages and timer

 * report the kernel-exported CSV list of I/O fields

The controller has a 3 msec debounce filter on its input. The minimum sensible cycle time therefore is 2 msec.
If you know that no input will change faster than once a second, increasing the timer values will save some power
and allow the program to react faster (since it usually doesn't need to wait for the controller to finish processing
its input+output list).

There can be at most one active server connection. A challenge/response mechanism is used to authorize the remote side.
